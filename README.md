# hex-dump

A custom hexdump utilitiy in Python. This was primarily done as an exercise in short circuiting list comprehension. The output contains info you'd expect from a traditional hex editor UI - hex value of the index of the first byte in the word, the hex value of the word, and it's printable representation.
